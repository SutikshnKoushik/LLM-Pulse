## Unreleased — LLM Pulse GitHub integration

- Brand the project as **LLM Pulse — AI Usage Intelligence** and link to the personal repository/profile while keeping the original LLM Usage Dashboard attribution and MIT copyright notice.
- Configure Electron publishing for `SutikshnKoushik/LLM-Pulse` and retain the existing app identifier and user data folder for upgrade compatibility.

## Unreleased — Codex quota bucket compatibility

- Fixed live Codex reset-history snapshot selection when `account/rateLimits/read` returns `rateLimitsByLimitId` keyed by a provider-defined ID rather than the literal `codex` key.
- The reset-history reader now prefers a valid explicit Codex bucket, otherwise selects the first valid non-Spark quota bucket, matching the live usage normalizer's behavior.
- Updated quota-integrity report wording so a missing live sample is not incorrectly described as specifically a weekly-window failure on Go/monthly plans.
- Added regression coverage for an opaque-key monthly Go bucket alongside a separate Spark bucket.
- Verification in this environment: `node --check` passed for changed JavaScript; quota-integrity core and CLI tests passed. `test/codex-reset-history.test.mjs` could not complete because this environment lacks installed `express`, which that test imports indirectly through `server.js`.

# Changelog

## Unreleased — English-first glass workspace

- Default fresh installs to English regardless of browser/OS language, while preserving an explicitly saved language choice; use English as the translation and native-notification fallback.
- Add a glassmorphism visual system with translucent surfaces, backdrop blur, soft gradient lighting, and a one-click glass effect toggle for users who prefer opaque panels.
- Add a Ctrl/Cmd+K command palette with searchable actions and direct navigation to dashboard sections; `/` also opens it when focus is outside an input.
- Add persistent Focus Mode, Compact Layout, and Reduced Motion preferences. Focus Mode hides secondary panels without hiding quota integrity, Codex reset history, provider cards, token history, or live metrics.
- Add keyboard navigation, accessible selected-command state, status announcements, and regression tests for the new workspace controls and English default.

## Unreleased — quota-integrity hardening

- Hardened local token-activity record validation so boolean and array values cannot be coerced into plausible token counts when stored JSONL is malformed or manually edited. Added regression coverage.
- Tightened "no local activity" evidence checks to require a fresh scan for every relevant local provider group; a fresh scan from Claude Code or another agent can no longer make an old Codex scan look current. Added a regression test and clarified the coverage rules.

## 1.6.0-preview.13 - 2026-10-14 (local customization)

### Quota investigation

- Add a quota-integrity analyzer for meaningful same-window usage rollbacks, reset-deadline changes before the previously reported deadline, stale Codex weekly samples, and grouped collector gaps.
- Add a PowerShell-friendly CLI report (`npm run diagnose:quota`) and authenticated `/api/quota-integrity` endpoint for local investigation.
- Add regression and privacy tests; document evidence limits so unusual observations are not misrepresented as proof of provider defects.
- Add a responsive **Quota integrity** panel (status, collector freshness, usage chart with findings and gaps, findings with measured / estimate / hypothesis blocks, quota increases compared with local activity, collection gaps, observed quota windows), localized in all 27 languages.
- Detect usage that rises without local token activity (for example remaining 5 % becoming 3 %), compared against a new counters-only local activity ledger (`token-activity.jsonl`). The verdict is only given when local logs demonstrably cover the interval; otherwise the step is reported as not assessable with a reason.
- Use reset-credit redemption and account switches as explicit evidence on rollbacks and early resets; report silent observation gaps (app closed, computer asleep) separately from collector failures.
- Go plan (30-day window) support, reviewed and completed: live Codex snapshots with a valid non-weekly window are recorded instead of being treated as collection failures; the window is chosen deterministically (weekly, else the longest); window durations and percentages are validated strictly; failure records carry a fixed reason code; every account and window type is its own series under the same names as the quota ledger (so one event seen by both sources is one finding); the weekly reset-history view reports the collector as live for a monthly-only account; activity records are loaded far enough back (36 days) and no absence claim reaches before the ledger's retention, fixing false "no local activity" warnings for 30-day windows and old steps; `codexWeeklySamples` is weekly-only with `codexLiveSamples` counting all; the CLI report and panel are labelled accordingly.
- Evidence model hardening (round 3): absence claims ("no local activity" and "only another local agent") now require proven coverage for every relevant log group, judged against the end of the 5-minute slot that contains the 10-minute lookahead, with plausible-clock checks, a freshness check for shared agents that have produced activity, and a scan that actually saw events. Missing, stale, skewed or damaged records always yield "not assessable".
- Ignore and count quota records dated after the analysis clock (a bad clock made a stopped collector look live or faked a rollback). Scan heartbeats now carry the time the log reads began.
- Ledger: fixed provider-group allowlist and strict validation of counters, timestamps and slot sizes; provider-log events with malformed counters count as activity but add no tokens.
- Report CLI resolves its data folder exactly like the server (including that `~\\` is not expanded), states where the folder came from, and warns on Windows when the installed app's folder holds newer history. Windows docs now separate source mode (`.\\data`) from the installed app (`%APPDATA%\\LLM Usage Dashboard\\data`) and list what must never be shared.
- Fix: repeated collector-failure rows were reported as one incident each; unused windows with rolling deadlines raised false "early reset" findings; the previous period's last observation is now carried in as a comparison baseline; CRLF and BOM data files are read correctly.

This is a local customization snapshot; it has not been published as an upstream release.

## 1.6.0-preview.12 - 2026-10-06

### Accounts and devices

- Add and manage multiple ChatGPT/Codex and Claude Code accounts in compact settings.
- Connect Kimi Code, GLM/Z.AI Coding Plan, OpenAI API, Anthropic API and Moonshot API accounts with their supported sign-in or key methods.
- Pair trusted installations for encrypted direct usage sync, then inspect all devices together or just one computer.
- Compare recorded tokens by installation, account, provider and model, with model details in chart tooltips and copied records counted once.

### Resets and performance

- Inspect Codex reset history and credits, with manual, scheduled, provider-inferred and unknown causes distinguished by their evidence.
- Preserve manual-reset evidence across a short failed status poll.
- Restore saved charts after restart and refresh in the background; speed up large histories and installation switching.
- Include Multica Codex session logs and keep this computer's live account limits visible.
- Refresh compatible desktop/build dependencies, including Electron 42.11.10 and electron-builder 26.15.3, and update proxy-addr to patched 2.0.8.

### Preview notes

- Direct sync needs reachable paired devices on a LAN or existing private network.
- Kimi Code exposes quotas; Moonshot API exposes balance. Complete token history is unavailable for these connections.
- macOS is ad-hoc signed without notarization; install the DMG manually. Windows installers are unsigned.
- Full notes: [1.6 release](docs/releases/1.6.0.md).

## 1.6.0-preview.11 - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Recognize manual Codex resets when a non-expired reset credit disappears across
  a short failed status poll. Keep inferred versus confirmed evidence and recording
  gaps visible; ambiguous accounts, overlapping windows and expiry stay unknown.

## 1.6.0-preview.10 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Restore completed token charts immediately after a restart, with the saved
  timestamp and a visible background-update notice; read live Codex limits separately.
- Calculate provider and Spark histories in one pass, preserving model totals,
  copied-record deduplication and each provider's full date range.
- Verify encrypted device histories in a background worker so startup does not
  block the dashboard HTTP server.
- Cancel obsolete chart requests when switching installations.
- Recheck actual source read access before using extraction caches, including
  Windows access-control permissions.

## 1.6.0-preview.9 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Skip parsing unrelated Codex message payloads while scanning large or active
  logs. Token events, model context and source line identities are preserved.

## 1.6.0-preview.8 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Reuse private, compressed token extractions after app restarts instead of
  rereading unchanged Codex, Claude and Gemini transcripts.
- Recheck source permissions, file fingerprints and parser versions; safely
  rebuild missing or damaged caches from the original logs.

## 1.6.0-preview.7 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Speed up large token histories by reusing device attribution across views
  and avoiding repeated daily calculations.
- Apply device changes made during a pending request immediately afterward,
  without displaying the previous device's response under the new selection.

## 1.6.0-preview.6 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Omit zero minutes from compact whole-hour durations, including recent quota
  pace measurements; retain actual minute values.

## 1.6.0-preview.5 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Automatically include Codex logs written into Multica session directories in
  local history, model breakdowns and device sync.
- Detect installations that only contain Multica sessions, while counting
  copied rollouts once across normal and Multica history.

## 1.6.0-preview.4 - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Show the recorded models and their token totals directly in installation
  chart tooltips, for the selected day or time window.
- Keep unknown models and shared observations explicit without counting copied
  usage twice.

## 1.6.0-preview.3 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Keep this computer's current Codex limits and active account status visible
  when viewing usage from all connected installations.
- Calculate combined histories in the background and reuse the last completed
  view while refreshing, so large histories do not block the desktop interface.
- Avoid rewriting the encrypted sync history when its snapshots are unchanged.

## 1.6.0-preview.2 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Keep pairing reliable while installations collect or synchronize large histories.
- Use clearly separated installation and account colors that stay consistent across date filters.

## 1.6.0-preview.1 - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Compare recorded token usage by installation or account in the charts,
  with matching legends, period totals and hover details.
- Show unknown account ownership explicitly and distinguish logs observed on
  several installations from records observed on one installation. Shared
  events still count only once in the combined view.

### Fixed

- Keep a signed snapshot stable throughout a direct transfer so new local
  activity does not repeatedly interrupt the first sync of a large history.

### Preview limits

- Historical account attribution requires account evidence in the original
  record. A currently signed-in account does not establish who owned old usage.
- An installation identifies where a record was observed; copied or migrated
  logs do not prove where the model request originally ran.

## 1.5.0-preview.2 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Keep recent quota pace available when measurements cover only part of the
  selected window, and display the duration actually measured.
- Apply the same freshness limit to every pace window so short refresh delays
  do not hide only the 30-minute view.

## 1.5.0-preview.1 - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Compact account manager with provider selection, browser sign-in for ChatGPT,
  Claude Code and Kimi Code, and separate key connections for GLM, Kimi Code,
  OpenAI API, Anthropic API and Moonshot API.
- Isolated local provider profiles and encrypted local API-key storage. Kimi
  prepares its pinned official helper on first browser sign-in.
- Installation overview with this computer always visible and a guided pairing
  flow, directly accessible from the dashboard header.
- Individual provider account quotas/reports and sanitized account snapshots
  in direct device sync, without adding overlapping API reports to local tokens.

### Improved

- Split settings into Accounts, Installations, General and Advanced tabs.
- Explain provider-specific access and missing measurements; API admin keys are
  distinct from consumer subscriptions. Update all 27 interface languages.

### Preview limits

- Claude Code must be installed; its official quota statusline needs actual
  session activity before values appear. Kimi initially exposes account quotas,
  not a reconstructed token history. API report coverage varies by provider.
- Use this version on every paired installation for the expanded account sync.
  Direct network reachability is still required; no relay is introduced.

## 1.4.0-preview.2 - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Support large usage histories up to one million stable events per device.
- Transfer only changed event blocks after the first sync, including quota-only
  changes, while verifying the complete signed snapshot before accepting it.
- Preserve the local view with a visible coverage error if the initial local
  snapshot cannot be created, instead of showing an empty combined total.

## 1.4.0-preview.1 - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Add multiple GPT accounts through OpenAI sign-in with separate local Codex
  profiles, and show account cards directly in the dashboard.
- Optional encrypted direct device sync, one-use pairing, automatic LAN
  rediscovery, offline snapshot history, and all-device/per-device usage views.
- Deduplicate stable local usage events across devices and show missing coverage.
  Credentials and conversation content never enter device sync.

### Security

- Serve icons locally and bind the desktop dashboard/proxy to loopback.
- Restrict account and pairing controls to the local app with origin/Host checks.
- Update affected Express/updater transitive dependencies to patched versions.

### Preview limits

- Direct reachability is required: no external discovery, relay, or automatic
  router/VPN setup. See [accounts and direct sync](docs/accounts-and-direct-sync.md)
  for supported sources, network limits, and the current security model.

## 1.3.0-preview.3 - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Show the cause separately from the timing of each Codex reset: credit-backed
  manual reset, inferred OpenAI reset without credit use, scheduled, or unknown.
- Keep historical causes unknown when credit evidence is missing, and show
  cause counts for the selected history period. Early timing alone is not an
  OpenAI reset; the person who triggered a reset remains unknown.

## 1.3.0-preview.2 - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Show the quota usage fill in the reset-history table in both light and dark themes.

## 1.3.0-preview.1 - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Local Codex reset history with available reset credits, announced reset dates,
  estimated window duration, early resets, and highest observed quota usage.
- Read-only background recording while the app runs, with account-separated live
  snapshots and reconstruction from existing quota/session logs.
- Evidence labels distinguish confirmed credit redemptions, inferred redemptions,
  stale overlapping windows, and recording gaps. No reset is consumed by the app.

## 1.2.0-preview.4 - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Keep recent-pace estimates visible through short quota refresh delays,
  while treating older samples as stale according to the selected time window.

## 1.2.0-preview.3 - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Find the Codex CLI in its current macOS app location so installed desktop
  builds can read live quota limits instead of falling back to old session logs.
- Date Codex limit badges from the quota reading itself, not from a failed
  refresh attempt or an unrelated token event.
- Keep recent-pace history together when two sources report the same weekly
  reset a few seconds apart.

## 1.2.0-preview.2 - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Show recent weekly quota pace for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 5 hours,
  including an estimated time until the limit at that pace. Each provider card
  now keeps its own selected comparison window and gauge/bar view.
- Show the exact day total and hovered model's tokens in history bar tooltips.

### Fixed

- Keep the chosen language across desktop app restarts, even when Electron
  assigns a new local port.
- Hide the 5-hour summary tile when no active provider reports that limit.
- Label recent pace with the selected comparison window and show the time
  remaining until exhaustion directly.
- Correct pricing of input tokens that were not served from cache.

## 1.2.0-preview.1 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Filter the API model catalog while typing a model name or API alias, with
  case-insensitive partial matches and translated empty-result feedback.
- Add GPT-6.1 Sol to the API model catalog with official input, cached-input,
  cache-write, and output rates. Keep GPT-6 Sol as a separate historical model.

### Updated

- Add GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna with official API token prices, cache-write
  prices, API/Codex aliases, and token limits. GPT-6 Terra is not listed
  because OpenAI has not published or exposed that model.
- Refresh the supported provider-price catalog, including current Claude Sonnet
  5 and DeepSeek V4.1 rates, plus the complete Arena Text score snapshot from
  September 13, 2026. Newly released GPT-6 Sol and Luna intentionally show no
  Arena Text score until that leaderboard publishes comparable results.

## 1.1.0-preview.19 - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Add the missing OpenAI GPT-6 Astra provider model with its official API token
  rates, cache-write rate, and context/output limits.

## 1.1.0-preview.18 - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Refresh the API pricing catalog with current official provider data, including
  the revised GPT-5.6 Sol and Claude Sonnet 5 rates.

### Added

- Add current Gemini, Grok, Qwen, and Mistral model rows while preserving
  retired Mistral aliases as explicitly unpriced historical mappings.

## 1.1.0-preview.17 - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Keep Claude visible in the standard provider view when the current week has
  recorded usage, even without current-day token activity.
- Retain an unexpired, last-confirmed Claude quota snapshot across app restarts
  and temporary live refresh failures instead of hiding the provider card.

## 1.1.0-preview.16 - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Add a translated appearance setting with System, Light, and Dark modes.
- Follow the operating-system appearance live on macOS, Windows, and Linux
  while keeping manual overrides across browser and desktop restarts.

### Improved

- Apply the selected appearance before the first visible render and extend the
  dark palette across dashboard surfaces, charts, controls, dialogs, focus and
  interaction states.

## 1.1.0-preview.15 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Correctly recognize Claude Max 5x and 20x plans from the German billing
  summary even when unrelated Team wording appears elsewhere on the page.

### Improved

- Move the local GPT account registry and its manual account re-scan from the
  main dashboard into Settings.

## 1.1.0-preview.14 - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Show every distinct ChatGPT account managed through common OpenCode
  multi-account stores and read each account's 5-hour and weekly quota
  independently.
- Retain the last successful per-account quota snapshot when a live refresh is
  temporarily unavailable or OpenCode switches to another account.

### Improved

- Watch built-in OpenCode auth plus `oc-codex-multi-auth` and
  `opencode-multi-auth-codex` account stores for changes while the desktop
  backend is running.
- Keep multi-account probing read-only: the dashboard never sends refresh
  tokens and persists only masked identities and normalized quota snapshots.

## 1.1.0-preview.13 - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Read the current 5-hour and weekly ChatGPT quota separately for every
  configured Codex home and reachable OpenCode OpenAI OAuth profile.
- Show quota coverage across active GPT accounts and mark an account's limit as
  unavailable when its current quota cannot be read.

### Improved

- Keep per-account quota probing read-only and privacy-safe: credentials and raw
  provider responses are never written to the local account registry.

## 1.1.0-preview.12 - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Keep the private GPT account-registry permission test strict on macOS and
  Linux while allowing Windows builds, where POSIX `0600` mode bits are not
  available.

## 1.1.0-preview.11 - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Track privacy-safe GPT account identities observed through Codex and OpenCode,
  keep previously seen accounts across sign-ins, and provide a manual account
  re-scan in the dashboard. OpenCode GPT token totals remain correctly labeled
  as OpenCode-wide when its database cannot attribute messages to an account.
- Show separate machine-readable Claude Fable limits from the browser/API or
  statusline telemetry. Multiple scoped Fable buckets remain separate from the
  general weekly limit, quota history, and notifications.

### Fixed

- Keep both all-time timelines at their latest data after delayed Electron
  layout measurement, refreshes, and real dashboard panel moves while still
  preserving intentional manual history scrolling.
- Hide empty setup-only providers such as an unused OpenCode GPT database from
  the normal provider view; they remain available through `Show all`.

## 1.1.0-preview.10 - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Keep both usage-history timelines pinned to the latest data after initial
  rendering and view changes, including when their scrollable layout settles
  after the first render frame. Intentional manual scrolling is still preserved
  during ordinary background refreshes.
- Restore dark, high-contrast styling for the Refresh and Settings buttons in
  the dashboard header, including the Refresh loading state.

## 1.1.0-preview.9 - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Hide GLM/Z.AI from the normal active-provider view when a generic OpenCode
  database exists but contains no GLM usage. GLM remains available through
  `Show all` and becomes active when GLM events or provider-specific quota
  configuration are detected.

## 1.1.0-preview.8 - 2026-07-19

### Improved

- Replaced the overlapping subscription actions with one contextual action:
  open the provider page when login is required, or read the plan again when a
  reusable browser session is available.

### Fixed

- Restored live Codex quota and plan reads after Codex moved into the ChatGPT
  macOS app, while retaining support for the legacy standalone Codex app,
  common CLI installations, and explicit binary overrides.
- Accept the authenticated plan reported by the ChatGPT/Codex app as the
  current plan, show the official price range when the exact variant is not
  available, and stop asking users to reconnect an already working account.
- Recognize the current ChatGPT billing layout that labels the active section
  as `Your plan`, including the displayed Pro tier price needed to distinguish
  the 5x and 20x variants.
- Keep browser fallbacks on the exact account domain and ignore partitioned
  Chromium cookies that would otherwise invalidate a reusable login session.

## 1.1.0-preview.7 - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Correctly classify Codex quota windows by their actual duration so weekly
  `primary` windows render as weekly limits instead of phantom 5h limits,
  including GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark and desktop notifications.

## 1.1.0-preview.6 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added read-only official GLM/Z.AI Coding Plan quota probing through the
  documented Z.AI Usage API, including the 5-hour token window and any other
  official windows returned by the provider.

### Improved

- Kept local OpenCode GLM token history separate from provider quota limits,
  with redacted unavailable diagnostics when auth, plan state, or endpoint
  access is missing.

### Fixed

- Hardened GLM quota auth discovery so generic OpenCode config files and
  malformed loose config text do not activate the GLM quota card or pair
  unrelated tokens with a Z.AI/BigModel base URL.

## 1.1.0-preview.5 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added read-only Claude Code OAuth quota probing for Linux/Manjaro so current
  Claude 5h and weekly usage windows can load without manually opening Claude
  Code, when the local session and provider endpoint allow it.

### Improved

- Clarified GLM/Z.AI over OpenCode cards: measured token usage remains visible,
  but official provider quota is shown as unavailable instead of estimating a
  quota gauge from tokens.

### Fixed

- Stopped showing stale Claude statusline quota windows as live limits and
  replaced Claude OAuth/API failures with safe, specific unavailable reasons.

## 1.1.0-preview.4 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Added a redacted Settings support report for Multica/WhatsApp diagnostics,
  including provider source status, freshness, failure categories, and a compact
  copyable summary.

### Improved

- Kept support-report UI text translated across all supported languages.

## 1.1.0-preview.3 - 2026-07-11

### Improved

- Clarified that logged-token summary cards show locally logged usage, not
  provider quota limits.
- Added provider breakdown notes to logged token summary cards.

### Fixed

- Kept total/provider/model token views consistent across Today, Last 24 Hours,
  Week, Month, and All Time for multi-provider local usage.

## 1.1.0-preview.2 - 2026-07-10

### Improved

- Delegate WhatsApp review releases

### Fixed

- Capture GLM usage from OpenCode

## 1.1.0-preview.1 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added automatic desktop update checks and release metadata support for new
  preview builds.
- Added GLM/Z.AI provider support. This should work, but still needs a real
  GLM setup verification.
- Added editable dashboard layouts, drag handles, and a record-day summary
  card.
- Added richer usage-history timeline controls, provider/model breakdowns, and
  token/cost views.
- Added live system/AI load gauges, source diagnostics, and notification setup
  helpers.

### Improved

- Reduced idle CPU, disk I/O, polling, and background refresh load across the
  server, Electron shell, and browser UI.
- Improved subscription, quota, pricing, and account-plan detection for Codex,
  Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and related providers.
- Improved usage cards, reset labels, scroll behavior, chart labels, provider
  colors, and app-wide scrollbars.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale provider cards and quota placeholders when local data is missing
  or outdated.
- Fixed token-history scroll position and current-time timeline handling.
- Fixed Windows CI coverage for injected process-metric fixtures.
